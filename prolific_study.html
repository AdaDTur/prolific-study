        <strong>We are conducting a study to compare the preferences of language AI systems and humans for various constituent orderings and sentence formations.</strong>
        In order to complete this experiment, we are collecting human preference data on how natural-sounding sentences are when organized in different ways.
        <strong>Your job is to read each pair of sentences, and give a rating for which sounds more natural than the other, and by how much.</strong>
        <br>
        The experiment should take under 10 minutes. Read and agree to the consent form below, and we'll begin with a short demonstration.

      <p class="center"> <strong>CONSENT FORM</strong></p>
      <p class="left" style="font-size:16px; color: darkslateblue;">
        You are invited to participate in a research study looking at the preferences of humans for constituent movement.
          Please read this form carefully and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to take part in the study. 
        </strong> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Investigators: </strong>Dr. Siva Reddy (Assistant Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science at McGill University),
        and students and research assistants under Dr. Reddy.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>What this study is about: </strong>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether language AI systems show similar 
        preferences to humans in constituent movement and orderings. 
        This is investigated in terms of various attributes of sentence constituents, AI system preferences on such data,
        and how these compare to human judgments.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>What we will ask you to do: </strong>In this study you read pairs of sentences, and answer questions about them. 
        We will also ask to collect some general information about your age, gender, level of education, and language to be able to better interpret the data, 
        <strong>but this portion is optional</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Risks and benefits: </strong>This experiment involves no known risks or discomfort to you beyond the risks of everyday life, nor is it expected to be of any direct benefit to you.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Compensation: </strong>You will be compensated according to the amount specified on the Prolific page. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Use of your data: </strong>The data collected in this study will be stored on a secure server and on a cloud-storage service (either Google Drive or Dropbox). 
        Your Prolific ID will not be directly linked to your data but will be stored separately (we only store the session ID). We will delete the separately stored Prolific ID from our files within 1 year at the latest.
        <br>
        The data we collect may also be used to illustrate the results of the research results in an online interactive site. 
        The anonymized data may also be published as part of an anonymous corpus distributed for further research. By consenting to releasing your data as a corpus, you will help ensure that your contribution will have a more lasting impact.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Taking part is voluntary: </strong>Your participation is completely voluntary. You are free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the project at any time without penalty. 
        However, data cannot be withdrawn after the information linking your Prolific ID to your data has been deleted. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>If you have any questions: </strong>You can contact Ada Tur (email: ada.tur@mail.mcgill.ca), undergraduate student under Dr. Siva Reddy, with any questions about this study. When communicating by email, 
        please be aware that information provided in emails is not absolutely safe and may be intercepted. This experiment is being run under the McGill Research Ethics Board protocols #401-0409/#342-0118.

        Great! Now we can start the real experiment. You will now read roughly 20 sentences. 
        Your task is to rate how natural each follow-up phrase is as a continuation to each starting phrase.
        For each continuation, you have the option (if you'd like—it would help us, but isn't mandatory) to explain, in as few words as you'd like, why it sounds natural or unnatural.
